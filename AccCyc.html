<font size=6 color=mediumvioletred>Steps of Accounting Cycle:-</font><br>
<br>
<font size=4>
An accounting cycle is a complete sequence starting with the recording of transactions and ending with the preparation of the final accounts. <br>

<li><font size=5 color=darkblue> Step-1: Identify Transactions </font><br>
The first step in the accounting cycle is Identifying transactions. Companies will have many transactions throughout the accounting cycle. Each one needs to be properly recorded on the company's books. <br>
Recordkeeping is essential for recording all types of transactions. Many companies will use point of sale technology linked with their books to record sales transactions. Beyond sales, there are also expenses that can come in many varieties. <br>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<font size=5 color=darkblue>Step-2: Record Journal Entries</font>  <br>
The second step in the cycle is the creation of journal entries for each transactions. Point of sales technology can help to combine steps one and two, but companies must also track their expenses. The choice between accrual and cash accounting will dictate when transactions are officially recorded. Keep in mind, accrual accounting requires the matching of revenues with expenses so both must be booked at the time of sale.
Cash accounting requires transactions to be recorded when cash is either received or paid. Double-entry bookkeeping calls for recording two entries with each transaction in order to manage a thoroughly developed balance sheet along with an income statement and cash flow statement. <br>
With double-entry accounting, each transaction has a debit and a credit equal to each other. Single-entry accounting is comparable to managing a checkbook. It gives a report of balances but does not require multiple entries. <br>
</li>
<br>
<li><font size=5 color=darkblue> Step-3: Post Ledger </font><br>
Once a transaction is recorded as a journal entry, it should post to an account in the general ledger. The general ledger provides a breakdown of all accounting activities by account. This allows a bookkeeper to monitor financial positions and statuses by account. One of the most commonly referenced accounts in the general ledger is the cash account that details how much cash is available. <br>
</li><br>
<li><font size=5 color=darkblue> Step-4: Unadjusted Trial Balance </font><br>
At the end of the accounting period, a trial balance is calculated as the fourth step in the accounting cycle. A trial balance tells the company its unadjusted balances in each account. The unadjusted trial balance is then carried forward to the fifth step for testing and analysis. <br>
</li><br>
<li>
<font size=5 color=darkblue> Step-5: Adjusted Entries</font> <br>
Adjusting entries update previously recorded journal entries. Their purpose is to ensure that the financial statements only have up-to-date and relevant information.
There are three main types of adjusting entries, deferrals, accruals, and estimates. <br>
<ul>
    <li>
Deferrals are money you spend, before getting any actual revenue or service. They include prepaid expenses and unearned revenues.
A prepaid expense is when you pay now for a future asset, like insurance. While unearned revenue is cash received before doing the work, and it’s recorded as a liability. An example would be your yearly newspaper membership.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Accruals, on the other hand, are revenues and expenses you haven’t immediately recorded.
Accrued revenue is cash earned but not yet received. If a customer delays payment for a month, that transaction is recorded as accrued revenue. Accrued expenses are the opposite, so expenses made but not yet paid. A common example is not paying your workers the salary until the end of the month.
</li>
<br>
<li>
 Lastly, we have estimates. Estimates are made for non-cash items when you can’t identify the exact value of them.
A typical estimate of a business is the depreciation expense. This expense is made for long-term assets, like vehicles or equipment. Since the exact cost machinery suffers can’t be measured in cash, there’s a formula that estimates that depreciation. That amount is then separated over many accounting periods, depending on how long the asset's useful life is. <br>
</li>
</ul>
</li><br>
<li>
<font size=5 color=darkblue> Step-6: Adjusted Trial Balance </font><br>
Now that you’re done with making adjusting entries, it’s time to put them in a new trial balance. This is once again done to prove that debits and credits balance in the end.
The adjusted trial balance has all of the data your business needs to prepare financial statements. <br>
</li><br>
<li>
<font size=5 color=darkblue> Step-7: Financial Statements </font><br>
After the company makes all adjusting entries, it then generates its financial statements in the seventh step. For most companies, these statements will include an income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. <br>
</li><br>
<li>
<font size=5 color=darkblue> Step-8: Close Your Books</font> <br>
Finally, a company ends the accounting cycle in the eighth step by closing its books at the end of the day on the specified closing date. The closing statements provide a report for analysis of performance over the period. <br> After closing, the accounting cycle starts over again from the beginning with a new reporting period. At closing is usually a good time to file paperwork, plan for the next reporting period, and review a calendar of future events and tasks. <br>
